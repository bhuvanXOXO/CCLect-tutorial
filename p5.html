        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        I have used Paisley Shape patttern from the Indian traditional culture. I have used Kinegram as a technique
        for creating the illusion of motion, making the pattern look animated.

      <p>
        I researched various patterns from traditional Indian arts and crafts and decided to go with the paisley pattern. 
        It is a very intricately design pattern which looks very regal in its final form. The intricacy of the pattern required a 
        lot of labor and skilled craftsmanship from artisans back in the day when there were no machines and therefore could only 
        be afforded by the rich, which also led it to be associated with royalty. Over time, the pattern got very popular through 
        trade and was brought into many cultures as well.

      <p>
        This assignment helped me better grasp the looping of the draw() function as an animating tool. It was also interesting to research
        into traditional patterns from my culture. I also reserached a lot of different illusions, which also was new knowledge.

        Katherine's Youtube tutorials for week 5 were a big help on this one for me. <br> Sean helped me understand creating grids and
        patterns in p5 in our lab class as well as touch-up my output. <br><br>
        
        I also used the Kinegram technique, the reference for which is below:
