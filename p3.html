      <p>
        <u>NOTE: refresh for different noodle effects<br></u><br>
        This is an experimental clock that captures my own sense of the abstract and experiential time-keeping 
        that we all seem to follow. This abstraction of time is based purely on our experience of our moment-to-moment life and has
        often been the topic of both science and philosophy. <br><br>
        Einstein once said "Einstein once said â€œsit with a pretty girl for an hour and it feels like a minute; sit on a hot stove 
        for a minute and it feels like many hours". My hot girl is food of course and my internal time-keeping for the day runs 
        almost sub-consciously based on the meals I've had and when I've had them. Unless i have my breakfast it doesn't feel like it's 
        10 am, nevermind that it's noon aready and unless I've had lunch it doesn't feel like it's 2 pm. 
        I have captured this experiential encapsulation of time into the single moment, in my clock, by miniaturizing the day (which runs on my meal clock)
        into an hour. The hour into a minute, while seconds move the same as an experience of enjoying food. <br><br>
        The time of the day has been completely abstracted for the user's experience on the mouse movement as a gradient for daylight. 
        Minutes are shown as meals, in gaps of 10 minutes. They depict the hours experienced as a function of thhe last meal.
        The seconds are shown in real-time (seconds) as a spaghetti noddle, highlighting my forever obsession with food.

      <p>
        I first drew out the concept as sketches on how I could use the idea of meals as an internal and automatic time-keeping mechanism.
        Once i had the idea finalised, i re-drew the final sketch (below), which I would base my p5 sketch on. I used perlin noise for the 
        wiggle of the noodle.

      <p>
        This assignment helped me acquire new skills and a new-found appreciation of mathematics all around us, which can help us
        code nature-identical phenomena. It also helped me grasp how real-time values can be used to make our sketch respond to the 
        live time of the day using the hour(), minute(), second(), millis() and frameCount() functions.

      <p>
        Xin Xin and Katherine Moriwaki's Critical Computation tutorials on YouTube and Sean's Lab session helped with this assignments. <br>
        Sean helped me with the mathematics for the perlin noise used in the wiggle of the noodle, in making it look realistic in its movement.<br>
