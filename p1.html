        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        My partner on this assignment, Zoe Wilks, had lost her necklace gifted to her.<br>
        Here is the item description given by her: <br>
        "An object I once lost was a necklace given to me by an Auntie of mine who passed away. 
        It is a very delicate, small gold chain with a tiny diamond and pearl, right next to each other; both placed 
        on the end of the long, gold loop at the bottom of the chain. 
        To this day, I still have no clue where it is. May have been lost in moving."
      </p>

        Design Process

      <p>
        I first drew out the necklace on a piece of paper and then replicated the drawing using simple ellipses and squares.
        I also applied some chain following effects between elements to make it look like a chain dangling from the tip of the mouse, 
        the link for which has been referenced in the credits.

        Reflection

      <p>
        This assignment really helped me give form to the 2D primitive shapes, understand the linear hierarchies that code follows:
        through the fill(), stroke() and rect() & ellipse() functions. <br>
        
        This assignment also helped me understand the looping feature of the draw() function in p5.js as well as the translate() and rotate()
        functions.

        Xin Xin and Katherine Moriwaki's Critical Computation tutorials on YouTube and Sean's Lab session helped with this assignments. <br>
        I got the chain effect in my necklace from the following reference on p5.js References Page:<br>
