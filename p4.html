        CLICK TO CREATE THE CORPSE'S TORSO! I have used the functions with parameters to allow the user to create the 
        middle part of the body as he goes about clicking. Apart from this, I have used the bezier() function to create flowers 
        and the face has mostly been created using the curveVertex().

        My partners in this game of Exquisite Corpse were Patricia and Rebecca and together we came up with an interseting
        corpse figure which was really funn for me to recreate using code. While Patricia had created a gemoteric human figure using 
        2D primitive shapes, Rebecca's was more abstractâ€“ it was a flower plant in a shoe. I chose Patricia's upper body because 
        it looked like a potrait painting which i found interesting. Similarly, Rebecca's middle torso, a dense folialge of red lillies
        built on the abstraction further. I planted this painting on the two strong muscular feet of my own corpse, which seemed to 
        bring some form of balance.

        This assignment was a great learning experience for me and allowed me to not only put a lot of my learnings to work but also 
        try and seek out more interesting things to do using code. Going about this assignment, I could get a much deeper understanding 
        of how modularity works in effect and how it can be plugged into so many things. It also makes the code so much clearer for
        others as well as oneself.

        Katherine's Youtube tutorials for week 2 were a big help on this one for me. Sean's CC Lab helpd me clear my concepts and execute 
        my ideas into code with confidence. The Coding Train tutorials in p5.js on YouTube are another source of my knowledge for this 
        assignment.
