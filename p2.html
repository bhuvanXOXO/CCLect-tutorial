        I have tried to change the face randomly using the keypressed button, but only alternatingly i.e. after every 
        random change it returns to its original shape on keypress before it's changed again. The purpose was to not lose
        the original essence once its indefinitely randomised. Apart from this, I have attempted to give the face three 
        expressions through mousePressed and color change on movement across the canvas.

        I first drew the extreme ends of the shape to which I wanted it move. I also tried to draw in the simplest
        way an expression could be depicted, which I decided to change on every click. To add more variation I tried to add 
        changing colors as one moves about the canvas.

      <p>
        This assignment was a great learning experience for me and allowed me to put a lot of my learnings to work. I helped 
        me understand the nuances of using coding syntax and awakened me to fresh possibilities of creative coding. I had never
        done anything like this before.

        Katherine's Youtube tutorials for week 2 were a big help on this one for me.
